                <p>There is a lot of uncertainty in the education system as usage of AI resources like ChatGPT and Grammarly rises exponentially. As a rising high school senior, I’ve experienced how drastically learning has changed since AI tools first arrived on the scene. Just this past year, one of my classmates’ essays had a “100% AI Generated” rating, and with no concrete evidence other than a newly-released AI checker, our teacher had no choice but to accept the essay. With incidents like these, it’s no surprise that people are wary of integrating AI tutors into the education system. However, as with any new technology, potential negatives should caution us on how we proceed rather than draw us away from them completely. When used in the right ways, AI tools have the potential to revolutionize education beyond imagination. 
</p>
                <p>One of the primary methods AI can assist students is through AI tutors. These are chatbots that utilize AI to help students learn by breaking down questions step-by-step and actively engaging the learner in finding the solution. Take this example from Khan Academy’s AI tutor, Khanmigo: 
</p>
<div class="post-image">
                    <img src="Khanmigo.png" alt="Khanmigo AI Tutor">
                    <p class="image-caption">Khan Academy's AI Tutor, Khanmigo.</p>
                </div>
  <p>
As you can see, AI tutors ensure students understand the material by breaking down the question and offering hints when needed. AI tutors address the concern of students losing the chance to critically think for themselves by forcing the student to understand each step of the solution, rather than revealing the entire answer at once. By working with the AI tutor through each step, the learner can easily pinpoint exactly where they are having trouble understanding. AI tutors allow students to feel comfortable asking as many questions as needed, and they can generate similar questions for practice as well as gradually increase the difficulty level.  
</p>
<p>
In addition to helping students grasp material better through practice questions, AI tutors can also be used to assist the educator in lesson plans as well. With the help of AI tutors, time used to create quality lesson plans and practice questions could instead be allocated towards helping students themselves. Imagine these three easy steps: upload a pdf of a textbook, specify the type of question (short answer, multiple choice, free-response, etc.), and specify how many questions you want; in addition to the generated questions, you also get comprehensive solutions and explanations. Elephantscale is already turning this idea into reality through their AI Tutor Avahi, which streamlines the process of curriculum development. Using this software would save time, money, and headaches as educators can now focus on other parts of their lesson plans. Not only that, but the applications of products like Avahi can extend past educational systems to other sectors and uses, such as teaching new employees in company training. 
</p>
<p>
AI tutors perfectly demonstrate the profound impact that AI can have on education. We must consider how we will integrate these resources into our current frameworks of teaching as these technologies continue to be refined. With the potential to revolutionize both how students learn and how educators teach, it is only a matter of time before AI tutors are used to help learners from around the world.
